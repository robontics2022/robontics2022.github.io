ID meeting: 940 2348 7142

Passcode: 298563

There is also a DISCORD

[https://discord.gg/He8PcRZu](https://discord.gg/He8PcRZu)

Where we have the #robontics channel to use to our liking.

The zoom link will become active a few minutes before the workshop's sessions on September 17th.

The physical location of the workshop will likely be room F6, on the sixth floor of the F-building of the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. The entrance is at Piazza Università, 1, 39100 Bolzano BZ. Note that you may be asked for proof of full vaccination and required to show the conference tag at the entrance.

Coffee-breaks and lunch will be served at Kolpinghaus on the roof terrace. A tip we've received to minimize travel: when downstairs at level 0 in the university, after passing the glass door, just go left, out in the street, and you will be just across from the Kolpinghaus.

For those of you who present a paper in person, there will be a computer in the workshop room that you can use for your presentation if you so prefer. If you instead prefer to use your own laptop, you must connect it to the workshop's Zoom room and to the beamer in the room.

For those of you present on-site, please do not connect to the Zoom room unless you do so for the purpose of holding your presentation. The Zoom call will be projected via the beamer.

And of course, on-site attendees must wear a face mask at all times while indoors.

We look forward to seeing you at the workshop!
